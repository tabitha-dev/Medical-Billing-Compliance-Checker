## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c2767b3-02d0-48c4-98af-c1c623d37e24)


The **Medical Billing Compliance Checker** is a single-page web application mockup designed to showcase the core functionalities of a system that helps healthcare providers ensure their billing practices adhere to complex medical regulations and payer policies. This project serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills using vanilla web technologies, simulating various interactions and data flows without a live backend.

It addresses critical aspects of medical billing compliance, including rule management, claims processing, code lookup, and reporting, all within a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features & Simulated Functionality

This mockup provides a comprehensive simulated experience of a medical billing compliance system:

* **üîê Authentication Flow (Simulated):**
    * Features a login screen with predefined roles: Admin, Billing Specialist, and Auditor.
    * Navigation links and content access dynamically adjust based on the logged-in user's role.
* **üìä Dashboard Overview:**
    * Displays key metrics like "Claims Processed," "Compliance Rate," and "Error Summary."
    * Includes a simulated chart to visualize "Claims Processed Over Time" using HTML Canvas.
    * Presents "Key Compliance Requirements" and "Specific Medical Billing Software Features" in visually distinct cards.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Rules Management:**
    * **Dynamic Rule List:** View a simulated list of billing rules (e.g., Medicare CPT-Diagnosis Mismatch, Medicaid Prior Authorization).
    * **Rule Filtering & Search:** Filter rules by status (Active, Inactive, Draft, Archived) and search by keyword.
    * **Rule Editor:** Select a rule to populate its details into an editable form.
    * **Simulated Actions:** "Save Rule," "Test Rule," "Import Rules," and "Export Rules" provide interactive feedback.
* **üßæ Claims Processing:**
    * **New Claim Entry:** Input mock patient, diagnosis, procedure, and charge details.
    * **Compliance Check:** Simulate real-time validation and generate mock compliance results (errors/warnings).
    * **Claim History:** Automatically adds new mock claims to a historical table.
    * **Appeal Process:** Clickable "Appeal" buttons trigger a simulated appeal modal.
* **üìö Code Search:**
    * **Tabbed Code Categories:** Browse simulated ICD-10, CPT, and other medical code lists.
    * **Unified Search:** Search across health topics and all code types, displaying mock results with descriptions.
    * **Healthfinder Integration (Mock):** Simulate fetching and displaying health topic details.
* **üìà Reports & Analytics:**
    * **Report Generation:** Generate simulated compliance summary, payer performance, and code usage reports.
    * **Export Options:** Simulate exporting reports to PDF and CSV formats.
* **üîí Audit Log:**
    * Tracks and displays simulated system actions, user logins/logouts, and key data changes for auditing purposes.
* **üîß Settings Management:**
    * Configure mock system settings, payer integration status, and manage user roles (simulated).
    * "Update Code Sets" and EHR/PMS integration changes provide simulated status updates.
* **üì± Mobile Responsiveness:**
    * The layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
    * Sidebars and multi-column layouts adjust gracefully on smaller screens.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using fundamental web technologies, emphasizing a lightweight and client-side approach:

</p>

## How It Works

The application operates entirely within the browser, simulating complex functionalities using in-memory mock data and client-side JavaScript logic.

1.  **Initial Load:** The login page is displayed first. Upon successful mock login, the dashboard becomes visible.
2.  **Data Simulation:** All data (claims, rules, codes, reports) is stored in JavaScript arrays within the browser's memory. There is no persistent backend database.
3.  **Dynamic Rendering:** JavaScript manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update content, filter lists, and display simulated results based on user interactions.
4.  **Simulated Actions:** Buttons and forms trigger JavaScript functions that log actions to a mock audit trail, display alerts, or update the in-memory data, giving the impression of complex operations.
5.  **Navigation:** Page switching is handled by toggling the `display` CSS property of different content sections.

## üèÅ Getting Started

---

## üîê Test Credentials

Use these predefined accounts to simulate role-based access in the app:

| Role              | Username | Password     |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| Admin             | admin    | password     |
| Billing Specialist| biller   | billingpass  |
| Auditor           | auditor  | auditpass    |

> These credentials enable simulated access to role-specific features and layouts in the application.

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tabitha-dev/Medical-Billing-Compliance-Checker.git](https://github.com/tabitha-dev/Medical-Billing-Compliance-Checker.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Medical-Billing-Compliance-Checker
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or use a local server extension (like Live Server for VS Code) for convenience.

## Future Enhancements Ideas

To evolve this mockup into a more feature-rich and robust application, consider these enhancements:

* **Persistent Data Storage:** Integrate a lightweight client-side database (e.g., IndexedDB) or, for a more advanced version, a cloud-based NoSQL database (like Firebase Firestore) to persist user data across sessions.
* **Advanced Rule Engine:** Implement a more sophisticated rule evaluation engine capable of processing complex logical expressions and dependencies.
* **Visual Rule Builder:** Develop a drag-and-drop interface for creating and modifying rules without writing code.
* **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Utilize a JavaScript charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to render dynamic and interactive graphs for reports.
* **Enhanced Form Validation:** Implement more granular and real-time validation for all form inputs, providing specific feedback for incorrect data formats.
* **User Profile Management:** Allow users to view and edit their own mock profiles.
* **Notifications System:** Implement a more robust notification system with different alert types and a dedicated notification inbox.
* **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities, adding ARIA attributes and improving keyboard navigation.
